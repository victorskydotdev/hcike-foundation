						<p class="paragraph">
							Chief Hyacinth Chukwunenye Ike, fondly known as HC Ike, was born
							on April 9, 1936, into the family of Late Pa Joseph Elizabeth Ikeh
							of Umuchoke, Umuokiri Umunumo in Ehime Mbano LGA, Nigeria. He was
							the second son in a family of nine children. Hyacinth, a humble
							and intelligent individual, attended St. Charles Primary School in
							Umuchoke, where he completed his primary education, obtaining his
							standard six first school leaving certificate. Although he faced
							constraints that prevented him from furthering his formal
							education, he found his calling in business.
						</p>

						<p class="paragraph">
							Hyacinth began his business journey in Benin, engaging in the
							rubber produce trade. He extended his entrepreneurial spirit by
							selecting and empowering young boys from his hometown to join him
							in the rubber business in Benin. His return to Umuokiri was marked
							by the introduction of a Gramophone Radio, a first in his
							community, and his engagement in basket weaving, a skill he shared
							with younger community members.
